## Features

- Slim & Fast. Strive to use built-in feature whenever possilbe.
- Most used command reachable under `C-c` and `super`.
- Versioned package dependencies using `straight.el`.
- Blazing fast startup. Thanks to `use-package defer` and native compilation.
- Separate places for your secrets.
- Sensible dired: omit non-interesting files, colorize by extension.
- Ligature support.
- More...

## Usage

Clone the repository:

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/azzamsa/emacs.d
```

Change the `use-package scripts.el` declaration into `azzamsa/secrets.el-dummy` as shown below.
The secrets are used for some functions such as [Ask Github If I Have New Notification](https://azzamsa.com/n/scripts-el/#ask-github-if-i-have-new-notification).
Separating the secrets this way ensures that my configuration is easy to share without worries.

``` emacs-lisp
(use-package secrets.el
  :straight (scripts.el :type git :host github :repo "azzamsa/secrets.el-dummy")
```

After you have the secrets.el repo locally. Insert your own secrets, then change back the configuration to `:local-repo "secrets.el"`.
So that it loads yours instead of the dummy one.

Now, Run your Emacs! ðŸš€
